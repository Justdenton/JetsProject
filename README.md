## JetsProject

#### Week 3 - Homework - Skill Distillery

### Overview

* The program simulates
* User Stories:
	* User Story #1: Create a JetsApplication with a main method to launch your program.  
	* User Story #2: Jets are found at an AirField. Create the AirField class, which has an empty List of Jets.
	* User Story #3: On program startup, populate the AirField with a total of 5 Jet instances representing each of your 3 defined Jet types. For example: 2 Cargo, 2 Fighter, and 1 Passenger kinds of Jets, where each instance has unique model, speed, range, and price. 
	* User Story #4:   
	* User Story #5: List fleet prints out the model, speed (in MPH), range, and price of each jet. (There must be 5 jets stored in the AirField when the program starts). 
	* User Story #6: Fly all Jets calls the fly() method on the entire fleet of jets. fly() prints out the model, speed (in MPH), range, and price and the amount of time the jet can fly until it runs out of fuel (based on speed and range).  
	* User Story #7: The view fastest jet and longest range options both display the jet's model, speed (in MPH), range, and price.
		Note: These methods must search the collection of jets to find the appropriate jet.  
	* User Story #8:  
	* User Story #9:  
	* User Story #10:  
	* User Story #11:
