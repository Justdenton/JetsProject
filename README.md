## JetsProject

#### Week 3 - Homework - Skill Distillery

### Overview

* The program simulates
* User Stories:
	* User Story #1: Create a JetsApplication with a main method to launch your program.  
	* User Story #2: Jets are found at an AirField. Create the AirField class, which has an empty List of Jets.
	* User Story #3: On program startup, populate the AirField with a total of 5 Jet instances representing each of your 3 defined Jet types. For example: 2 Cargo, 2 Fighter, and 1 Passenger kinds of Jets, where each instance has unique model, speed, range, and price. 
	* User Story #4: There is a menu with these options:
		* List fleet
		* Fly all jets
		* View fastest jet
		* View jet with longest range
		* Load all Cargo Jets
		* Dogfight!
		* Add a jet to Fleet
		* Remove a jet from Fleet
		* Quit
	* User Story #5: List fleet prints out the model, speed (in MPH), range, and price of each jet. (There must be 5 jets stored in the AirField when the program starts). 
	* User Story #6: Fly all Jets calls the fly() method on the entire fleet of jets. fly() prints out the model, speed (in MPH), range, and price and the amount of time the jet can fly until it runs out of fuel (based on speed and range).  
	* User Story #7: The view fastest jet and longest range options both display the jet's model, speed (in MPH), range, and price.
		NOTE: These methods must search the collection of jets to find the appropriate jet.  
	* User Story #8: The user is presented with an option specific to the interfaces you created. For example, Load all Cargo Jets, above, finds all implementors of the CargoCarrier interface and calls loadCargo() on each. (Note that the menu text is italicized because your options may be different, depending on your interfaces.)  
	* User Story #9: A user can add a Jet to the fleet. This can be PassengerJet (or 1 of your choosing).
		* Stretch Goal: This leads to a sub-menu where the user chooses the type of Jet.
		* Users are prompted to enter the Jet's model, speed (in MPH), range, and price, and it is added to the AirField. 
	* User Story #10: A user can remove a jet from the fleet.
		* The user is presented with a sub-menu allowing them to select which jet in the fleet to delete by its number. 
	* User Story #11: The program continues until the user selects the option number to Quit, which exits the program.
